          <h3>PIG GAME</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          In the Pig game, two players take turns rolling a die. They continue
          rolling until they get a 1, at which point their turn ends and the
          other player gets a chance to roll. Players accumulate points during
          their turn, but if they roll a 1, they lose all the points they've
          collected in that turn. The first player to reach 100 points wins the
          game.

          <h3>Guess My Number Game</h3>
        </a>
        <p>
          In the "Guess My Number" game, a random number is generated, and
          players must guess what it is. With each incorrect guess, the player
          loses one point. The game provides hints, indicating whether the guess
          is too high or too low. The high score is tracked and updated
          throughout the game. The goal is to guess the number with the fewest
          attempts to achieve the highest score
